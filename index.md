Digits is an application that allows users to: 

  * Register an account with multiple users.
  * Create and manage a set of contacts.
  * Add a set of timestamped notes regarding user's interactions with each contact.

## Installation

First, [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Then create a database for your application.

```

$ createdb nextjs-application-template
Password:
$

```

Second, go to [https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template), and click the "Use this template" button. Complete the dialog box to create a new repository that you own that is initialized with this template's files.

Third, go to your newly created repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system. Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```

$ npm install

```

Fifth, create a `.env` file from the `sample.env`. Set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to match your PostgreSQL database that you created in the first step. See the Prisma docs [Connect your database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-postgresql). Then run the Prisma migration `npx prisma migrate dev` to set up the PostgreSQL tables.

```

$ npx prisma migrate dev
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "<your database name>", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

Applying migration `20240708195109_init`

The following migration(s) have been applied:

migrations/
‚îî‚îÄ 20240708195109_init/
‚îî‚îÄ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.

‚úî Generated Prisma Client (v5.16.1) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 51ms

$

```

Then seed the database with the `/config/settings.development.json` data using `npx prisma db seed`.

```

$ npx prisma db seed
Environment variables loaded from .env
Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed.ts` ...
Seeding the database
Creating user: admin@foo.com with role: ADMIN
Creating user: john@foo.com with role: USER
Adding stuff: Basket (john@foo.com)
Adding stuff: Bicycle (john@foo.com)
Adding stuff: Banana (admin@foo.com)
Adding stuff: Boogie Board (admin@foo.com)

üå± The seed command has been executed.
$

```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed and the database seeded, you can run the application by invoking the "dev" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/master/app/package.json):

```

$ npm run dev

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.2.4

- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

‚úì Starting...
‚úì Ready in 1619ms

```

### Viewing the running app

### User Interface Walkthrough

The following sections describe the major features of this template.

#### Landing Page

When you first bring up the application, you will see the landing page that provides a brief introduction to the capabilities of Digits:

<img src="doc/digits-landing-page.png">

#### Register

If you do not yet have an account on the system, you can register by clicking on ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù, then ‚ÄúSign Up‚Äù.

#### Sign In

Click on the Login link, then click on the Signin link to bring up the Sign In page which allows you to login.

#### User Home Page

After successfully logging in, the system takes you to your home page. It is just like the landing page, but the NavBar contains links to list contact and add new contacts.

#### Add Contacts

Clicking on the Add Contacts link brings up a page where you can now add new contacts.

#### List Contacts

Clicking on the List Contacts link brings up a page that lists all of the contacts associated with the logged in user

This page also allows the user to add timestamped ‚Äúnotes‚Äù detailing interactions they‚Äôve had with the contact.

You can click the "Edit" link to go to the Edit Contact page, shown next.

#### Edit Contact

From the List Contacts page, the user can click the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù link associated with any contact to bring up a page that allows that contact information to be edited.

#### Landing (after Login), Admin User

You can define an "admin" user in the settings.json file. It is possible to designate one or more users as ‚ÄúAdmins‚Äù through the settings file. When a user has the Admin role, they get access to a special entry in the navbar that retrieves a page listing all contacts associated with all users.

#### Admin Page (list all users contacts)

To provide a simple example of a "super power" for Admin users, the Admin page lists all of the contacts by all of the users.

Note that non-admin users cannot get to this page, even if they type in the URL by hand.
